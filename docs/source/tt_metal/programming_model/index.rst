TT-Metalium is a platform for programming heterogeneous collection of CPUs (host processors) and Tenstorrent acceleration devices,
composed of many RISC-V processors. Target users of TT-Metal are expert parallel programmers wanting
to write parallel and efficient code with full access to the Tensix hardware via low-level kernel APIs.
