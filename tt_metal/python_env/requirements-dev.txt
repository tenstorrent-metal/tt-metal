# As this is a development environment, some build backend dependencies may
# not be available during environment installation. We recommend setuptools
# and wheel before installing this requirements.txt file.

# During dep resolution, black may install platformdirs >=4.0.0, which is
# a breaking dependency for virtualenv installed by pre-commit. virtualenv
# requires <4.0.0 platformdirs, so we're pinning platformdirs here
