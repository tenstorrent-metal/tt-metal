//  Device writes data into the completion queue for host to read back
//  command_queue_consumer and remote_completion_queue_writer (to be added) kernels write into the completion queue for MMIO or remote device respectively

// One core dispatches commands to worker cores on the device `dispatcher`
// The `remote_x` cores are used for remote fast dispatch and receive / transmit fast dispatch packets from ethernet cores

// std::optional is used to determine whether core has been assigned
// tt_cxy_pair is used over CoreCoord to denote location because remote device command queue interface cores are on the associated MMIO device
